# Ex. No. 8 - PROTOTYPE PART MODEL DESIGN IN 3D PRINTER

### DATE: 
## AIM: 
### To prototype the given part model design in 3D Printer.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### ●	3D Printer machine.
### ●	CURA 4.0 Software.
### ●	Autodesk Fusion 360 Software.
### ●	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

### Step 1:- Check all Electrical connections.

### Step 2:- First we install the software related the 3D printer (idea maker, ultimaker etc.)In idea maker first open the software and click the open file option as shown in below figure.

### Step 7.:- After generating the gcode format then follow the these instruction as shown in below figure.
###   1.	Switch on the 3d printer.
###   2.	Place your Pen drive in USB.
###   3.	Clean the surface bed plate.
###   4.	Load filament into the required extruder as per the requirement.
###   5.	Wait until the nozzle & bed plate comes into the required temperature.
###   6.	Close the doors of the 3d printer.
###   7.	Open the file from the USB storage and select the Print option.

## Output:
## LOAD STL FILE
Import the stl file of the 3d model into cura software.

## ORIENTATION
Proper orientation of object may reduce the use of support material thereby reduces the use of cost and time spend during printing process.Placing part of model with more surface area lie on print bed reduces the use of support material.

## SCALING
Scaling is helpful in increasing and reducing the product size along x,y,z axes.

## MOVE
move option is used change the print position of the product to be printed on the print bed.
